# Dress to Diva (D2D)

### This is a remake of an old blog CMS I created back in 2014. It was originally Bootstrapped and written in PHP, MySQL, and jQuery.
#### This latest rendition has been translated to WordPress (Wordpress.org) and uses PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript.

It is a culmination of over a year's worth of hard work, containing over 1000+ photos taken using a Canon DLSR camera, and a lot of customization for the blogger.
